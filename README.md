## Projects

### CNN Image Classification
- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of cats, dogs, and horses.
- Managed a dataset of over 30,000 images with data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Utilized TensorFlow and Keras for model development.
- Achieved high accuracy in image classification.
- **Code**: [files-to-directories.py](CNN/files-to-directories.py), [train-with-baseline-model.py](CNN/train-with-baseline-model.py), [predict-with-baseline-model.py](CNN/predict-with-baseline-model.py)

### Regression Salary Prediction
- Created regression models for predicting salaries based on demographic and professional features.
- Performed data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.
- Employed Scikit-learn for building and evaluating models.
- Focused on regression analysis and predictive modeling.
- **Code**: [salary_prediction_v3.py](Regression/salary_prediction_v3.py)
